Simulate Hi-C data for any rearranged karyotype - fast!                               

This package can be used to simulate Hi-C data for highly rearranged genomes, using the [gGnome](https://github.com/mskilab-org/gGnome) framework. It contains utilities to simulate hypothetical rearranged genomes, and also to perform inference on existing Hi-C data for an unknown rearranged karyotype.

Disclaimer: the data used in the development of this model are post-processed from the high-depth Hi-C library published by Rao et. al. (2014). See the original paper [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25497547/)
